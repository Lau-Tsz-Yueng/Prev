Outstanding Bugs as of Version 0.7.9
====================================

The NewFeatures24 metric does not yet check for 
the following 2.4 features:

* Unified integers (PEP 237)
* Simplified string substitution Template subclass (PEP 292)
* Reversd iterators (PEP 322)
* Subprocess module (PEP 324)
* Decimal module data type and context (PEP 327)
* Multi-line imports (PEP 328)
* Locale-Independent Float/String Conversions (PEP 331)
* dict.update() method now accepts the same argument forms as 
  the dict constructor
* ljust(), rjust(), and center() now take an optional argument 
  for specifying a fill character other than a space.
* rsplit() method that works like the split() method but splits 
  from the end of the string
* Three keyword parameters, cmp, key, and reverse, were added 
  to the sort() method of lists.
* Built-in function sorted(iterable)
* Integer operations will no longer trigger an OverflowWarning.
* New interpreter switch, -m, that takes a name, searches for 
  the corresponding module on sys.path, and runs the module as 
  a script.
* The eval(expr, globals, locals) and execfile(filename, globals, 
  locals) functions and the exec statement now accept any mapping 
  type for the locals parameter.
* None is now a constant.
* zip() built-in function and itertools.izip() now return an empty 
  list if called with no arguments.

There is no warning that the NewFeatures24 metric is unable to 
check for runtime features or syntax changes that would raise an error. 
Also, it is unable to check for updated library modules.
