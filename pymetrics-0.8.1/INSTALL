There are two steps to install PyMetrics:

Step 1: Untar the compressed pymetrics-xx.xx.xx.tgz tarball. 
   It creates a subdirectory called pymetrics-xx.xx.xx where
   xx.xx.xx is the version number. For example:

	$ cd someplace
	$ tar -xvzf pymetrics-xx.xx.xx.tar.gz

	This creates the subdirectory "pymetrics-xx.xx.xx" 
	in directory "someplace".

Step 2: Use Python's standard setup.py method to install 
        PyMetrics in the normal Python library.

See README for details on running PyMetrics.

That's it. Enjoy.
