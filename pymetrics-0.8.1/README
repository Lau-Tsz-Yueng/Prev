For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.

To run PyMetrics, enter either

	python PyMetrics.py
or
	./PyMetrics.py

It will give you instructions on how to use the program 
and list its options.

The subdirectory "./examples" contains two dreadful test 
programs. While you can use them, you can also use any of 
the Python source modules in this directory as examples.
